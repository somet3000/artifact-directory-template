Title:
Comparing the Effects of Increased Sequencing Coverage on Analyses of Human Genetic Variation

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies determine associations between variants at individual genomic positions, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and various phenotypes such as height or diabetes. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are SNPs that are significantly associated with gene expression for a certain gene. The link between genetic variation and observable phenotypes is poorly understood. eQTL analyses link genetic variation to gene expression, and these associations can then be used to inform how gene expression affects downstream phenotypes. These associations can be further refined using downstream analyses like fine-mapping or functional annotation enrichment which can pinpoint the location of causal variants across the genome. However, sequencing coverage, which is the amount of times an individual base pair is sequenced on average in a sequencing experiment, can have major implications affecting statistical power to detect SNPs, indels, and rare variants. In this analysis, we combine eQTL analysis with fine-mapping to compare high-coverage and low-coverage sequencing datasets for a cohort of individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project.
